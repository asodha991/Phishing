# WhatAPhish: Detecting Phishing Website
Website Phishing costs internet users billions of dollars per year. Phishers steal personal information and financial account details such as usernames and passwords, leaving users vulnerable in the online space. Traditionally, the ad-hoc methods have been used to detect phishing attacks based on content, URL of the webpage, etc. It is difficult to detect phishing websites because of the use of URL obfuscation to shorten the URL, link redirections and manipulating link in such a way that it looks trustable. We present a machine learning based approach combining several features to attain the best results. Among various classification models, Random Forest Classifier and Support Vector Machine were able to classify most accurately with least number of false positives. After analysing, we used SVM which achieved an accuracy of 96.29% on test data and 97.95% on training data with a set of 25 features spanning over broad categories of URL parsing, pagesâ€™ source code and URLs embedded therein and domain based statistics. We then created a web-platform WhatAPhish to deploy the obtained results.
